# Tony's self hosted non-custodial zap collector, built to support his efforts of promoting censorship resistant protocols.

![avatar](https://nostr.build/p/nb6717.png)

Hi, my name is Tony, and my goal for the past 4 years has been educating the curious minds on sound money, censorship resistance, freedom, privacy, and security. This page is meant to highlight what I believe my greatest achievements are and try to find some support from the community for me to continue my work. All materials I produce are distributed freely, never paywalled or hidden from the ones in need of knowledge, and will always remain that way. Information must be set free and I'm doing my best to make it happen!

That said, my native language is Russian and most of my work is dedicated to educating the Russian-speaking community, however I am working on a few projects in English:

-   [BitCal](https://bitcal.21ideas.org/about/) -- a calendar of the most important historical Bitcoin events. The website already hosts the historical events and my next goal is to prepare a calendar that everyone will be able to download to their smartphone and a Nostr bot that will be notifying the Bitcoin history freaks by relays.

-   [Nostr Guides](https://habla.news/p/npub10awzknjg5r5lajnr53438ndcyjylgqsrnrtq5grs495v42qc6awsj45ys7) -- I am a resident on Habla News, where I post concise guides on how to best interact with Nostr and corresponding apps and tools.

My work in my native language is much more vast:

21ideas
-------

[21ideas](https://www.21ideas.org/) is an educational bitcoin-only website launched in 2019 that provides fundamental materials for a multinational Russian speaking community. Everything shared by the project is freely available and will always remain that way. Materials on the website include my own work and translations of dozens of articles, books, videos, podcasts and more. Among the authors are Alex Gladstein, Giacomo Zucco, Robert Breedlove, Nick Szabo, Jameson Lopp, and many more. 

I've translated (or took active part in translating) and shared a number of [books](https://www.21ideas.org/tag/book/): 

-   [Inventing Bitcoin](https://www.21ideas.org/book-inventing-bitcoin/) by Ian Pritzker;

-   [Sovereignty Through Mathematics](https://www.21ideas.org/book-stm/) by Knut Svanholm;

-   [The Sovereign Individual](https://www.21ideas.org/books-sovereign-individual/https://www.21ideas.org/books-sovereign-individual/) by William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson;

-   [In Defence of Deflation](https://www.keepandshare.com/doc30/110348/in-defense-of-deflation-1-pdf-1-1-meg?tr=77) by Philipp Bagus;

-   [The Blocksize War](https://www.21ideas.org/book-the-blocksize-war/) by Jonathan Bier.

The project is being maintained for the people of ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º, ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦, ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿, ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¿, ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡², ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡ª, ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿, ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¬, ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡©, ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¯, ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¾, and many more... ðŸ§¡

Bitcoin for Everyone
--------------------

"[Bitcoin for Everyone](https://www.21ideas.org/basics-bitcoin-course/)" is a Bitocin-only course, inspired by Saylor Academy that I've prepared for the Russian-speaking community. It is meant to [provide a newcomer](https://www.21ideas.org/tag/basics/) with all necessary knowledge and tools to interact with the greatest invention of our time in a [secure](https://www.21ideas.org/tag/security/), [private](https://www.21ideas.org/tag/privacy/), and efficient way. 

NOSTR FILES
-----------

[NOSTR FILES](https://nostr.21ideas.org/) is an educational Nostr resource that holds all the vital info on Nostr -- basics, guides, articles and podcasts, prepared and categorized by yours truly. It aims to bring the understanding of open and free communications protocols to my fellow comrades, which I find vital considering current circumstances.

Bitcoin Herald 
---------------

[Bitcoin Herald](https://www.21ideas.org/tag/bitcoin-herald/) is a weekly Bitcoin-only newsletter, aimed to keep fellow comrades in the know of the most important events in the Bitcoin world and warn them on the dangers of shitcoining.

1008 Blocks Later
-----------------

[1008 Blocks Later](https://www.21ideas.org/1008-blocks-later/) is a weekly podcast based on Bitcoin Herald, where we invite prominent Russian-speaking bitcoiners and discuss the most important (and sometimes dangerous) events of the past week. It aims to raise Bitcoin awareness and push adoption in the region.

I find sharing Bitcoin knowledge in the Russian speaking community important, as residents of Russian speaking countries are in need of censorship resistant tool (even though many are still not aware of their need).

Please support my work, so I can continue spreading the Bitcoin word:
